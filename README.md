## Overview

This project is an AI full-stack application that demonstrates how modern web systems can integrate cloud-hosted large language models (LLMs) into a production-style architecture.

The system consists of a React-based frontend and a FastAPI backend. Users submit natural language commands through the web interface, which are processed by the backend using a managed LLM service. The backend enforces structured AI outputs, persists results in a database, and returns normalized responses to the frontend.

This project was built to showcase hands-on experience with AI integration, full-stack development, and cloud deployment patterns.
